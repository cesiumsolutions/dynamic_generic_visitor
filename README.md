# Generic Dynamic Visitor 

This repository contains the source code to demonstrate the design and evolution
of a Generic _and_ Dynamic Visitor library. The git commits represent the steady
progression starting from a "classic" implementation of the Gang-of-Four's
Visitor Design Pattern to a Generic and further on to a Dynamic implementation
of the pattern.
